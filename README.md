# Working title: "Lost among undead"

## What's in there so far
### 1)
For now, you can walk and aim with default controls. But the sprinting was added
You have only the pistol. But ive implemented the ammunition and shooting mechanic

### 2)
The zombies for now are just cubes that walk directly towards you, Cant't attack for now. You are in godmode !

### 3)
There is only one map, which is forest with dense fog. (I have to admit that for now it looks like you're hunting zombies, not vice versa)

### 4) 
More should come when I have some time :D

### 5) 
You now have health which goes down, when zombies are nearby with red frames indication, but when you get away from them, it slowly regenerates

### 6) What is planned to be added (depends on ursina possibilities and my competence)
-Remade player control w/o default one
-Camera shakes when running, reloading, shooting and beaing attacked
-Adding more sounds (walking, running, zombie sounds)
-Small optimization via compressing and cutting sound files along with texture resolution
